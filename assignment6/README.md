###I wasn’t able to get scrapy to run and scrape the website. Here’s the commands I ran in the terminal once in the correct file path. 
###scrapy  startproject assignment6
###cd assignment6, cd assignment6
### scrapy genspider str https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance
### I then created the code in the spider str file in the assignment6 folder in pycharm and updated the code in items
###finally in the terminal I entered scrapy crawl str -O assignment6.csv:csv, which is blank unfortunately.
