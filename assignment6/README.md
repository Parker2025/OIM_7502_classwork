I just added in the code after work today, but I'm still not getting it to fully run.  I'm no longer getting the issue I had originally sent. So, I'm going to continue to try and troubleshoot on my own. 
Thanks for the help on this Professor!  

3/24 I unfortunately still am not able to get scrapy to run effectively.  I'm wondering if it could have something to do with my computer?
